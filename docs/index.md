# Welcome to the choice-learn documentation!

A toolbox for choice-modeling


Choice-Learn is a Python package designed to help you build discrete choice models.
The package provides ready to use datasets and different models from the litterature. It also provides a lower level use if you want to customize any model or create your own from scratch. In particular you will find smart datasets handling to limit RAM usage and different structure commons to any choice model.

Choice-Learn uses NumPy and pandas as data backend engines and TensorFlow for models.

In this documentation you will find examples to be quickly getting started as well as some more in-depth example.
